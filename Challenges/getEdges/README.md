# Find Edges
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

Graph has many nodes, some of them are connect to each other and they have weights some of them are not connected to each other.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function based on the specifications above, 

which takes in a graph, 

and an array of city names. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return whether the full trip is possible with direct flights, 

and how much it would cost.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

Create a List<(string,string)> result to store the final result;

Take in one city in the cities arrat and using GetNeighbors(Vertex v) from Graph class to get the list of its neighbors,

then check the rest of the cities in the cities array, if they all exists in the lists, add their weights and add "True,cost",otherwise add "False, $0"

in the end , return result list and print it on the screen.



T->O(n);
S->O(n);
