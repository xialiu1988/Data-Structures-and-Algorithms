##LinkedList


Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.



Within  LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.



This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to head when the linked list is instantiated.


Insert : takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
Time: Big O=O(1); Space:O(1);



Includes: takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.



Print: takes in no arguments and outputs all of the current Node values in the Linked List.


Append:  Add the value to the end of the list
          Time: Big O=O(n); Space:O(n);


InsertBefore: Insert a node with new value in front of some specific node.
               
			  Time: Big O=O(n); Space:O(n);

			   
InsertAfter:  Insert a node with new value in front of some specific node.
                Time: Big O=O(n); Space:O(n);
